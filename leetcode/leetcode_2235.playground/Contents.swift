/*
 Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.
  
 Example 1:
 Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
 Output: 17
 Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.
 
 Example 2:
 Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
 Output: -6
 Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.

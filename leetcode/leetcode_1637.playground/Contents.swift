/*
 Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.
 A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.
 Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

 Example 1:
 Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
 
 Example 2:
 Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
 Output: 3
 Constraints:

 n == points.length
 2 <= n <= 105
 points[i].length == 2
 0 <= xi, yi <= 109

            last = points[i]
